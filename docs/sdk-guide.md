# SDK Developer Guide

This guide is for developers building client libraries that connect to the MACP Runtime. It covers the practical patterns your SDK needs to implement: envelope construction, authentication, error handling, streaming, and retry logic.

For protocol-level SDK conformance requirements, see the [protocol SDK parity documentation](https://www.multiagentcoordinationprotocol.io/docs/sdk-parity). For transport binding specifications, see the [protocol transports documentation](https://www.multiagentcoordinationprotocol.io/docs/transports).

## What your SDK should handle

A well-built MACP SDK takes care of seven concerns so that application code can focus on coordination logic:

1. **gRPC transport** -- Connection management, TLS configuration, and metadata injection.
2. **Authentication** -- Storing tokens and attaching them to every request.
3. **Envelope construction** -- Building protobuf-encoded envelopes with correct version and mode fields.
4. **Message ID generation** -- Producing unique IDs for deduplication.
5. **Session ID generation** -- Creating IDs in an accepted format (UUID v4/v7 or base64url).
6. **Error handling** -- Distinguishing transient from permanent failures and applying appropriate retry logic.
7. **Streaming** -- Managing `StreamSession` connections, handling inline errors, and recovering from lag.

## Starting a connection

Every SDK session should begin with an `Initialize` call:

```
-> InitializeRequest {
     supported_protocol_versions: ["1.0"],
     client_info: { name: "my-sdk", version: "1.0.0" }
   }
<- InitializeResponse {
     selected_protocol_version: "1.0",
     capabilities: { sessions: { stream: true }, ... },
     supported_modes: ["macp.mode.decision.v1", ...]
   }
```

Cache the response. Use `selected_protocol_version` as the `macp_version` in all subsequent envelopes. Check `capabilities` to determine which features are available and store `supported_modes` for client-side validation before sending.

## Building envelopes

Every message to the runtime is wrapped in an `Envelope`:

```protobuf
message Envelope {
  string macp_version = 1;       // Always "1.0"
  string mode = 2;               // Mode identifier (empty for signals)
  string message_type = 3;       // "SessionStart", "Proposal", etc.
  string message_id = 4;         // Unique per message
  string session_id = 5;         // Target session (empty for signals)
  string sender = 6;             // Set by SDK, overridden by runtime
  int64 timestamp_unix_ms = 7;   // Current time in milliseconds
  bytes payload = 8;             // Protobuf-encoded mode-specific payload
}
```

The runtime overrides `envelope.sender` with the authenticated identity. If the SDK sets a sender that does not match, the request is rejected. The safest approach is to either leave `sender` empty or set it to the expected authenticated identity.

**Message IDs** must be unique per sender. UUID v4 is a good default. The runtime deduplicates on `message_id`, so sending the same ID twice returns a duplicate acknowledgement without reprocessing.

**Session IDs** must be UUID v4/v7 (hyphenated lowercase, 36 characters) or base64url tokens (22+ characters). UUID v4 is the simplest choice.

**Payloads** are protobuf-encoded bytes. Import the mode-specific `.proto` files, serialize the payload struct, and set `envelope.payload` to the resulting bytes.

## Error handling

### Error categories

Errors fall into five categories, each with different retry semantics:

| Category | Examples | Retry? |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Transient** | `RATE_LIMITED`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, network timeout | Yes, with backoff |
| **Envelope errors** | `INVALID_ENVELOPE`, `INVALID_SESSION_ID`, `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | No -- fix the request |
| **State errors** | `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, `SESSION_NOT_OPEN`, `SESSION_ALREADY_EXISTS` | No -- session state is permanent |
| **Auth errors** | `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `FORBIDDEN` | No -- fix credentials or permissions |
| **Policy errors** | `POLICY_DENIED`, `UNKNOWN_POLICY_VERSION` | No -- fix policy or session configuration |

### Idempotency

The `Send` RPC is idempotent on `message_id`. If a network error occurs after sending but before receiving the acknowledgement, the SDK can safely retry with the same `message_id`. The runtime returns `Ack { ok: true, duplicate: true }` for already-processed messages.

### Retry strategies

For `RATE_LIMITED` errors, wait for the rate window to expire (default: 60-second sliding window) or use exponential backoff starting at 1 second with a 30-second cap.

For `INTERNAL_ERROR` or network failures, retry with the same `message_id` using exponential backoff (100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms) up to 5 attempts with a 10-second cap.

For `ResourceExhausted` on a stream (lag detection), reconnect the stream, call `GetSession` to verify the current state, and resume from there.

## Streaming

### When to use Send vs StreamSession

Use `Send` when you need an explicit acknowledgement per message, or for fire-and-forget with retry (idempotent via `message_id`). Use `StreamSession` for real-time observation of a session or high-frequency message exchange.

### StreamSession lifecycle

A `StreamSession` connection follows this pattern:

1. Open a bidirectional stream.
2. Send the first envelope, which binds the stream to that `session_id`. Alternatively, send a **passive subscribe** frame (RFC-MACP-0006-A1) where `envelope` is absent and `subscribe_session_id` is set -- the runtime replays accepted history from log index `after_sequence` and then delivers live envelopes on the same stream. Set `after_sequence = 0` to replay from session start; use a higher value to resume after a known checkpoint.
3. Receive accepted envelopes from all participants in the session.
4. Send additional envelopes as needed (not required for passive observers).
5. The stream closes on client disconnect, lag overflow, auth failure, or server shutdown.

All envelopes on a stream must target the same session. A single frame must not set both `envelope` and `subscribe_session_id` -- the stream terminates with `InvalidArgument` if both are set. Passive subscribe is authorized for the session initiator, declared participants, and observer identities; non-participants receive an inline `FORBIDDEN` error frame without closing the stream.

Application-level errors (validation failures, authorization denials) are delivered as inline `MACPError` messages and the stream stays open. Transport-level errors (unauthenticated, internal, unknown session on subscribe) close the stream.

### Handling stream lag

The runtime's broadcast buffer holds 256 envelopes per session. If a client falls behind, the stream terminates with `ResourceExhausted`. Your SDK should detect this, call `GetSession` to learn the current session state, reconnect with a new stream, and resume processing.

## Capability negotiation

After `Initialize`, check the runtime's capabilities to determine what features are available:

```python
resp = client.initialize(...)

if resp.capabilities.sessions.stream:
    # StreamSession is available
if resp.capabilities.cancellation.cancel_session:
    # CancelSession is available
if resp.capabilities.policy_registry.register_policy:
    # Policy management is available
```

SDKs should degrade gracefully when capabilities are absent rather than failing.

## Version negotiation

Send supported versions in descending preference order. The runtime selects the highest mutual version. If no match exists, it returns `UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION`.

Unknown fields in protobuf messages are silently ignored, so SDKs built for protocol version 1.0 will work with a 1.1 runtime -- new fields are always optional.

## Testing your SDK

### Against a local runtime

```bash
MACP_ALLOW_INSECURE=1 cargo run
# SDK connects to localhost:50051 sending Authorization: Bearer <sender-id>
```

### Test checklist

- Initialize with version negotiation
- SessionStart with all required fields
- Full message flow through to commitment for each mode
- Duplicate message handling (same `message_id` returns duplicate ack)
- Error paths (invalid payload, forbidden, session not found)
- StreamSession connect, receive, and lag recovery
- GetSession returns correct metadata
- CancelSession by initiator succeeds, by non-initiator fails

## Proto files

Proto definitions are available in the `macp-proto` crate:

```
macp/v1/envelope.proto                      -- Envelope, Ack, MACPError
macp/v1/core.proto                          -- All RPCs, SessionStartPayload, CommitmentPayload
macp/v1/policy.proto                        -- PolicyDescriptor, policy RPCs
macp/modes/decision/v1/decision.proto       -- Decision mode payloads
macp/modes/proposal/v1/proposal.proto       -- Proposal mode payloads
macp/modes/task/v1/task.proto               -- Task mode payloads
macp/modes/handoff/v1/handoff.proto         -- Handoff mode payloads
macp/modes/quorum/v1/quorum.proto           -- Quorum mode payloads
```

Generate language-specific bindings using `protoc` or `buf`.
