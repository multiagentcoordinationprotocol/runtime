# MACP Runtime Documentation

**Version**: v0.4.0 | **Protocol**: MACP 1.0 | **Language**: Rust

The MACP Runtime is the reference implementation of the [Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol](https://www.multiagentcoordinationprotocol.io). It is a coordination kernel written in Rust that enforces session boundaries, validates messages, manages append-only history, and serializes concurrent agent interactions over gRPC.

This documentation covers the **runtime implementation** -- how to build, configure, deploy, and integrate with it. For protocol-level concepts like sessions, modes, signals, determinism, and the two-plane architecture, see the [protocol documentation](https://www.multiagentcoordinationprotocol.io/docs).

## What the runtime provides

The runtime ships as a single binary that exposes 22 gRPC RPCs over TLS. It supports the five standards-track coordination modes (Decision, Proposal, Task, Handoff, Quorum) and one built-in extension mode for iterative convergence. A governance policy framework evaluates rules at commitment time, and pluggable storage backends (file, RocksDB, Redis, or in-memory) handle persistence with append-only logs and checkpoint-based replay.

Authentication is layered as a resolver chain: JWT bearer (when an issuer and JWKS are configured), then static bearer tokens, with a dev-mode fallback only when neither is set. Identities expose capability flags -- `allowed_modes`, `can_start_sessions`, `max_open_sessions`, `can_manage_mode_registry`, and `is_observer` -- that are enforced on every request. Per-sender sliding-window rate limits cover both session creation and message throughput. Session lifecycle transitions can be observed in real time through `ListSessions` and `WatchSessions`, and accepted envelope history can be replayed into a stream via passive subscribe.
